      "Checking your rate on Gro Capital will not affect your credit score. If you proceed with your application after receiving a rate, your credit score may be impacted. When you check your rate, we make a 'soft credit inquiry.' Soft credit inquiries on your report do not lower your credit score. If you are offered a loan and proceed with the application, a 'hard credit inquiry' will be completed to verify the accuracy of your application. This action will be recorded as an inquiry on your report and it may impact your credit score.",
