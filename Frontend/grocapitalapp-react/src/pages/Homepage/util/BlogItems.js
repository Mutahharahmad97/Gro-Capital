When you’re just starting on your journey to creating a business, you need the ability to develop and produce products, distribute them, have funds for marketing, and hire people to help do it all.

These are ways to maybe think outside of the box to get the funding you need to start the business of your dreams.

      {"Borrow from friends or family.":"While this isn’t always the ideal way to get startup capital for your business idea, the fact is many entrepreneurs do start with this type of funding. Be sure that every person you’re asking to invest in your concept understands its complexities and what they’re investing into and get it all laid out in writing."},
      {"Crowdfunding":"This is one of the more popular ways to raise startup capital in the social media generation. Instead of giving ROI on investments, you offer gifts and perks for anyone who crowdfunds your project. Keep in mind to really create an effective campaign for these types of funding. You will have to put together a sizzle reel and invest in mock-ups of your products."},
      {"Personal Business Loans":"You also can get financing for your small business through personal loans from your bank and other online lenders. These can be an effective option for borrowers who have an excellent credit history and strong income. Whatever stage in starting your business you’re at, it’s never too early to outline where you will focus on raising your startup capital.

      `Raising money for your business idea is an extremely tiring and even more frustrating process that is filled with pitfalls, disappointments, and small victories here and there. However, while there are so many entrepreneurs trying to get their next great idea off the ground, there are some things you can do to ensure that your concept and package stand out from the crowd.
      When it comes to finding seed capital, preparedness is your ultimate weapon against failure and disappointment. The better prepared you are to be funded, the more likely you’re going to get the seed capital you’re searching for.
      Today, we wanted to look at some of the things you can do to ensure that you are prepared as possible for your long and arduous journey ahead. Here are our proven steps to preparing your business.`,
    subParts:[
      {"Improve your credit score":"The first step to funding your business with seed capital is to get your finances entirely in order. This is because your business has no credit history, so any loans or funding that you’re asking to borrow is going to be collateralized with your personal credit history. In addition, your business doesn’t have a profit and loss statement, so it’s all on you."},
      {"Build a killer business plan":"Investing the time to build a killer business plan is the best way to creating your business. Unfortunately, it’s also incredibly time-consuming. Remember, though, that by investing that time in research, financials, projections, and more that are included in your comprehensive business plan, you’re showing any potential investor just how committed you are to your business. A thorough and well-done business plan will go a very long way to raising seed capital."},
      {"Invest in your financials":"This is critical to your business plan. A plan without financials will get instantly laughed out of the conference room. You won’t even get the meeting without them. That’s how essential they are. Any potential funder wants to, of course, hear all about your big idea. They want to see how you work the room and your energy, but above all else, they want to know they’re getting paid back, and they want to see how you’re going to do it. Put the right foot forward by having your ducks in a row and invest the time to get your finances mapped out and ready to go."},
      {"Understand your financing options":"Whether you’re considering doing crowdfunding, angel investors, VCs, or raising money from private lenders, you need to know ahead of time what your funding options are. Understand which ones make the most sense for your business and ensure the greatest success at every step."},
      {"Perfect your pitch":"Practice, practice, practice! No matter where you’re going to be presenting your pitch to investors, be sure that you know it inside and out and that you’re prepared for any assortment of questions or concerns that will come your way during your actual pitch. The more intimately you know your pitch, the better your chances are in the room. As you’re looking for seed capital for your business, be sure that you keep these steps in mind to better prepare for your journey ahead and ensure success in your funding. Whatever your business funding needs are, Gro Capital is here to help!"}
